# Office-data-bank
In this project we made a program which depicts the data of employees in an ordinary office  We used all the major concepts of Object oriented programming which we have studied in this projectâ€™s code First we made an abstract class which includes two pure virtual functions, this is a concept of polymorphism  We made another info class , which is a general class having all the general variables like name, age, salary, ID and two member function to get and display general information. These two functions are overriding the pure virtual functions made in abstract class. Then we made a manager class which inherit the info class through the concept of inheritance . This manager class have two extra variables, work experience and education  We made another class Internie , which contains education as an extra variable We used the concept of composition in this class to make an object of info class in internie class and call the member functions of info class from that object. We made another class low grade employees which also is a child class of info class and this class contains static data member  and static function which count the total number of low grade employees This class also contains an  overloading binary operator which add the salaries of all employees to calculate the total wage bill and return that value as an object. In the main section we made info class pointer in which we stored the address of manager class object and we called manager class functions from that pointer through the concept of late binding. In the output the user will ask to enter the data of employees User have to enter the details like NAME,AGE,ID and SALARY Then the program display details like date of joining and total number of lowgrade employees and total wage bill of both employees etc
